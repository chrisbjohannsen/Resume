### Experience

### Sr DevOps Engineer at [Olo](https://olo.com) - 10/2021 - Present
As a Senior DevOps Engineer at Olo since November 2021, I play a pivotal role in addressing the infrastructure needs of the Release Engineering team. My responsibilities extend to maintaining our in-house release management application and overseeing the release pipeline for Olo's monolithic Platform codebase and associated dependencies. Additionally, I manage, support, and monitor our build and deployment infrastructure and environment. In my previous assignment, I served as a DevOps engineer within a traditional operations team before transitioning to the Release Engineering team in July 2023.

  ##### *Key Achievements:*
- Facilitated the migration of teams from legacy, manually configured infrastructure to modern Infrastructure as Code (IAC) infrastructure.
- Enhanced TeamCity/Octopus build and deployment pipelines to deploy IAC and applications seamlessly as part of the CI/CD Pipeline.
- Implemented the integration of Octopus Deployment Events into Datadog, creating dashboards for real-time deployment visibility and alerting.
- Collaborated with the team to migrate RedHat Ansible Tower to AWX.

### Sr Software Engineer at [Olo](https://www.olo.com)  - 11/2019 - 10/2021
During my tenure as a Senior Software Engineer in the Ordering Group at Olo from December 2019 to November 2021, I focused on projects aimed at ensuring reliability at scale, particularly in response to the challenges posed by the COVID-induced performance crisis. My contributions spanned the Public HTTP API, where I built new services to extract functionality from a monolithic codebase, simplifying team ownership and enhancing visibility. Additionally, I supported the design and implementation of new features and mentored the team towards Scrum processes.

  ##### *Key Achievements:*

- Developed a genericized message processing library to abstract underlying messaging technologies (SQS and Kafka).
- Supported the design and implementation of an order archival system to reduce load on the primary SQL server.
- Created a fully containerized integration test suite for the order archival system.
- Reduced the load on the primary SQL server by migrating application log data from MSSQL storage to Redshift via AWS Kinesis.
- Represented the team on the Containerization Cohort, contributing to the elevation of containerized development at Olo.


### Sr Software Engineer at [Tenable](https://www.tenable.io) - 12/2017 - 10/2019
As a Senior Software Engineer at Tenable Network Security, I specialized in backend services, addressing performance issues with data export processes, and contributing to the hardening of new services for production deployments. My responsibilities included implementing data persistence layers and REST API layers for new microservices utilizing Postgres and DynamoDB datastores. I gained expertise in Kafka event processing pipelines and contributed to the coding and deployment of JVM-based microservices.

  #### *Key Achievements:*
- Successfully performed production hardening of a Kafka-based streaming service.
- Coded and deployed several JVM-based microservices, replacing monolithic PHP services.
